# Mapping Earthquake

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to dynamically visualize earthquake data in real-time. The interactive map displays a comprehensive collection of earthquake occurrences worldwide over the past 7 days. The circles on the map are sized and colored to accurately represent the magnitude of each earthquake.


## Dataset Info

Data for this visualization is sourced from GeoJSON provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS updates earthquake data in various formats every 5 minutes, ensuring the most current and accurate information is reflected on the map. For additional details, please refer to the USGS earthquake data feed: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
